## 💼 Projects

### 📌 Insurance Fraud Detection
Built a machine learning pipeline using XGBoost to detect fraudulent insurance claims. Deployed the model using Streamlit for real-time prediction. Focused on feature engineering, data imbalance handling, and pipeline deployment.

### 📌 Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Reviews
Scraped product reviews from Flipkart using BeautifulSoup and performed sentiment analysis using TF-IDF and logistic regression. Created a word cloud and sentiment score dashboard.

### 📌 Retinal Diabetic Detection (CNN)
Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify retinal fundus images into diabetic or non-diabetic categories. Worked with real medical image datasets and used TensorFlow/Keras for model training and evaluation.

### 📌 Placement Prediction Using ML
Created a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a student's placement based on academic scores, skills, and certifications. Utilized logistic regression and decision tree algorithms with proper data preprocessing and visualization.
